<!-- ✅ WHAT IS MARKETING TROUBLESHOOTING -->
<section class="content-block">
    <h2>What Is Marketing Troubleshooting & Repair?</h2>
    <p>Marketing Troubleshooting & Repair is about clarity, not guesswork. We take a close look at your existing marketing — whether it’s PPC, SEO, content, or design — and figure out why it’s not performing the way you want. Maybe the leads aren’t converting, maybe the traffic has slowed, or maybe your ads just don’t hit like they used to.</p>
    <p>It starts with understanding what’s in place, what you’re aiming for, and what’s getting in the way. Sometimes the setup has cracks. Sometimes the strategy has blind spots. And sometimes, Google moves the goalposts on you.</p>
    <p>Whatever it is — we find it, fix it, and move your marketing forward. You tell us where you want to go. We get you there.</p>
</section>

<!-- ✅ WHAT WE TROUBLESHOOT -->
<section class="content-block">
    <h2>What We Troubleshoot</h2>
    <p>If it’s part of your marketing — we can fix it. From SEO disasters to disapproved ads, broken funnels, missing tracking, slow-loading websites, or mysterious drops in leads… we’ve seen it all, and more importantly, we know how to solve it.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Technical and on-page SEO issues</li>
        <li>Google Ads problems (banned, underperforming, or misconfigured)</li>
        <li>Analytics and tracking that isn’t firing correctly</li>
        <li>Conversion bottlenecks and confusing user experiences</li>
        <li>Ad disapprovals and account restrictions (Google, Meta, etc.)</li>
        <li>Backlink audits to remove SEO penalties</li>
        <li>Content gaps or brand messaging breakdowns</li>
        <li>Industry-specific restrictions (medical, adult, legal, etc.)</li>
        <li>Online reputation management & crisis response</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Even if you don’t know what’s broken — that’s okay. We’ll find it, fix it, and help you start winning again.</p>

<!-- ✅ CLIENT WIN EXAMPLE -->
<section class="content-block">
    <h2>Client Win: From Fix to Full-On Expansion</h2>
    <p>A local chiropractor came to us frustrated — his marketing wasn’t pulling in new clients, and he didn’t know why. His only strategy was traditional TV, which brought in older clientele but failed to reach a younger audience.</p>
    <p>We started with a clear fix: diagnose the issue, then shift his approach to modern channels like PPC and targeted social campaigns. That alone opened the door to a younger, more responsive audience.</p>
    <p>But we didn’t stop there. Once the fix was in place and the growth began, we helped him build out a bigger vision — one that led to two additional office locations.</p>
    <p>He came in needing a solution. He left with a strategy that scaled his business.</p>

<!-- ✅ PROCESS BREAKDOWN -->
<section class="content-block">
    <h2>Our Process</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Understanding You:</strong> Start by learning about you, your business, your goals, and where you want to go.</li>
        <li><strong>Identifying the Problem:</strong> Tell us what you think is wrong, and we use that as a launchpad to investigate.</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnosis and Analyzation:</strong> We analyze your marketing across the board — campaigns, structure, targeting, technical performance — and identify exactly what’s causing the gap between where you are and where you want to be.</li>
        <li><strong>Building Your Customer Profile:</strong> We define your ideal customer — not just demographics, but behavior: where they spend time, what grabs their attention, and what motivates them to act.</li>
        <li><strong>Crafting a Strategy:</strong> Once we know the problem and the audience, we create a plan. Whether it’s a quick fix or a full strategy overhaul, you’ll see what needs to happen and why — mapped clearly.</li>
        <li><strong>Execution Based on Your Wants:</strong> This is your business. You tell us how far you want to go — fix the issue, or go big — and we build accordingly. If you want to shine like a star, we’ll show you how. If you just want the machine running again, we’ll do that too.</li>
    </ol>
